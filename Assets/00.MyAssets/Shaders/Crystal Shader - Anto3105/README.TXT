Thanks for purchasing my crystal shader :)

The shader needs to be set up in this way:

Main Texture: *OPTIONAL* to add a main texture to the model
Base Color: the base color, it will be multiplied by the Main Texture if there is one
Normal: *OPTIONAL* normal map for the model
Normal Strenght: the strength of the normal map
Mask Map: *OPTIONAL* adds a mask map
Metallic: controls the metallic amount
Smoothness: controls the smoothness amount
Transparency: controls the overall transparency of the model, using also the main texture alpha if there is one
Caustic Texture: texture to apply the refraction effect of the crystal
Parallax Amplituyde: value to control the amplitude of the caustics
Parallax Steps: value to control the recursion of the parallax effect
Emission Color: this is the main color of the crystal, it's an HDR color so try increasing the intensity to create particular effects
